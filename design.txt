We want 2 things from Blink right now (This might change)

List of all videos
Health of all cameras

This data will be stored in an sqlite db as follows:

Table "videos":
id = unique video id
link = video link in S3
timestamp = unix timestamp for when the video was created

Table "cameras":
id = unique camera id
name = camera name
battery = integer value of the camera
